# Robot Programming Assignment


## Steps to Run the Program


### Step 1: Build the workspaceÔÉÅ

Unzip or clone the [project file](https://github.com/Nditah/CMP9767-27455742)

Ensure that your Docker service is running, then open the project folder with VS Code.

VS Code will propmt you to reopen as a container. Accept and watch the logs on terminal

In the root of the workspace, run colcon build. 
This allows the installed files to be changed by changing the files in the source space for faster iteration.

```bash
colcon build --symlink-install
```



### Step 2: Source the environment

When colcon has completed building successfully, the output will be in the install directory. Source them to add all of the required elements to your path and library paths as well as provide any bash or shell commands exported by packages.

```bash
source install/setup.bash
```
